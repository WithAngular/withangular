## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to [monacodelisa](https://github.com/monacodelisa).

## Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.
Instead, we recommend using Discussions to ask support-related questions.

## Features vs Bugs

Not all issues are bug fixes! Please understand the difference between a Feature and a Bug when it comes to issue creation.

- **FEATURE** - when you are implementing something new that has not been worked on before
- **BUG** - when you are correcting something that has been worked on before but is not functioning as intended

## For all Issues 
### First open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed.

This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

## Submitting an Issue

Before opening an issue, please search through Issues to see if a similar issue has been raised. Existing discussions may provide useful insights or workarounds.

To expedite bug fixes, a minimal reproduction of the issue is required. This concise example helps in swiftly identifying and addressing the problem.

Providing a minimal reproduction is crucial for saving time, increasing the chances of a quick resolution, and ensuring that focus is given to the correct issue.

**DO NOT** erase the provided issue template! It is intended for you to use, not to replace it with random text.

It is always a good practice to look up existing issues and ensure your new issue matches the established
format. This helps maintain consistency and makes it easier for others to understand and collaborate on the
issue

## 'Needs Triage' issue label

Every new issue is tagged with the "needs triage" label, signifying that it requires review and assessment by a core team member. This process ensures that issues are appropriately prioritized and assigned, fostering a collaborative environment where tasks are synchronized to prevent conflicts. While you focus on addressing an issue, it's important to recognize that others may be working on related tasks. Therefore, the "needs triage" label serves as a precautionary measure, indicating that the issue is not yet ready for immediate attention. The issue will be ready to work on, once the "needs triage" label is removed.

## Before you start working on an Issue

Before commencing work on any issue, it is essential to confirm that it has not already been addressed. Please check for existing implementations and if the chosen issue has already been resolved in a different app version, review the existing implementation and replicate it accordingly.

Even if the issue is labeled as not implemented, it remains your responsibility to examine the app's codebase and confirm the absence of the issue.

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [withangular](https://github.com/WithAngular/withangular) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission.
   You don't want to duplicate existing efforts.

2. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add.
   Discussing the design upfront helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.

3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the `withangular` repo.

4. In your forked repository, make your changes in a new git branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch main
   ```

### The default branch is main

5. Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.

6. Follow the [Coding Rules](#coding-rules) and [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines).

7. Run the full test suite, as described in the developer documentation, and ensure that all tests pass.

8. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

   ```shell
   git commit --all
   ```

   Note: the optional commit `--all` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

9. Push your branch to GitHub:

   ```shell
   git push origin my-fix-branch
   ```

10. In GitHub, send a pull request to `withangular:main`.

### Important: Using Closing Tags in PRs 

To improve issue tracking and automate maintenance, always use GitHub’s **closing keywords** when your PR resolves an issue. That is why the following prase is already included in the template:
- `Closes #`

GitHub uses it to automatically close the referenced issue when the PR is merged. This ensures that issues are properly managed and prevents duplication of work.

### Do Not Erase the PR Template
The PR template is provided to streamline contributions. Please fill it out properly rather than replacing it with random text.

It is always a good practice to look up already merged PRs and ensure your new PR matches the established format. This helps maintain consistency and makes it easier for others to understand and collaborate.

## PR Scope
### New Contributors:
 - **Work on one issue per PR**. This keeps the review process straightforward and reduces potential conflicts.
  As you gain familiarity with the project, you may work on multiple related issues in a single PR.

### Returning Contributors :
- A you continue to contribute you may slowly gradually increase the amount issues within a single PR, but all issues must be properly documented and all of them must be tagged with `Closes #<issue_number>` in the PR description.
- Ensure that each issue addressed in your PR is documented clearly.

### Core Team Members:
- Core team members can work on as many issues as needed within a single PR.
- They may **also introduce small, non-breaking fixes or enhancements** that they discover while developing.
- Not all of these changes need to be tied to a specific issue, **as long as they are documented clearly in the PR description**.
- This flexibility allows for continuous improvements while maintaining project stability and traceability.

## Reviewing a Pull Request

We reserve the right not to accept pull requests from community members who haven't been good citizens of the community.

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

- Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

  ```shell
  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
  ```

- Check out the main branch:

  ```shell
  git checkout main -f
  ```

- Delete the local branch:

  ```shell
  git branch -D my-fix-branch
  ```

- Update your local `main` with the latest upstream version:

  ```shell
  git pull --ff upstream main
  ```

## Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code and the different app versions, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

### FILE STRUCTURE

#### Components

Store full components that can be used on their own, in the `components` folder, examples include:

- `header`, `footer`, `posts`, `layout`, `dashboard`

#### Dialogs

Place popups/ modals/ dialogs, in the `dialogs` folder, examples:

- `follow-dialog`, `search-dialog`

#### Partial Components

Place partial components like dialogs and other smaller reusable components, in the `partials` folder, examples:

- `social-icons`, `hero-banner`

### Interfaces

Keep interfaces in the `models` folder, examples:

- `user.model.ts`, `user.ts`
- Avoid duplicating existing interfaces.

#### Services

- Place services in the `services` folder, examples:
  - `data.service.ts`, `theme.service.ts`

#### Pipes in the `pipes` folder

#### Directives in the `directives` folder etc.

#### Page Folder Exclusion

- Omitting a pages folder due to the current absence of an extensive component count, that would justify its introduction.

For clarification on component categorization or any other building block, cross-reference with implementations in other app versions or seek guidance through communication.

### NAMING CONVENTIONS

- For dialogs, ensure the inclusion of the term `dialog` in the name.
- Maintain consistency with established naming conventions in other app versions.
- Propose suggestions for improved and clearer naming in discussions or comments.

### STYLE GUIDE

#### The project utilizes SCSS. Copying and pasting CSS from other sources would be accepted only if it is formatted correctly to comply with SCSS conventions.

#### use relative measurements in the `scss` files:

- `rem`, `%`
- `wh`, `vh`, `dvw` `dvh`
- avoid using `px`

### MEDIA QUERIES

The placement for media queries is the standard placement - below all the other styles.

## INDENTATION & FORMATTING

Maintain the project's indentation and formatting. Do not include formatting changes in your PRs, only include code that you have changed. It doesn't look like you have done more when you submit a PR with tons of indentation changes - we all see its just indentation and that makes it even more unpleasant to deal with.

## Commit Message Guidelines

To maintain a clear and organized version history, we follow a standardized commit message convention. This ensures that each commit provides valuable information about the changes made. Please adhere to the following guidelines when crafting your commit messages:

### Feature:

```
feat(component): add new feature X
```

### Bug Fix:

```
fix(component): resolve issue with Y
```

### Documentation Update:

```
docs(readme): update installation instructions
